## Author
Cara Ottmar, Version 1.0.0

## Overview 
Implement an **in-order** traversal function that returns a string of the visited nodes.

# Architecture
 Set up your configuration:
  README.md -- with a documentation about your lab
  gitignore -- with a robust .gitignore
  eslintrc -- with the class .eslintrc file
  eslintignore -- with the class .eslintignore
  package.json -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies
  lib/ -- directory for holding your programs helper modules
  __test__ -- directory for holding your programs unit and integration tests
 
 Create your Node and Binary Tree classes, and use your main.js to build your binary tree.
